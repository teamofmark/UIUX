A healthy ocean
Not only is it home to over 700,000 species of life, but it is also essential to the survival of the planet. Providing food and jobs to billions of people, the ocean is vital to human health and well-being.

But now the ocean is more at risk than ever before, from plastic waste, destructive fishing, and rising sea temperatures. If we work together, we can save the ocean, its countless marine creatures, and its people.
