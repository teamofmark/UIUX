A new voyage for more marine protected areas - Exploring the Sargasso Sea

Written by: Greenpeace Seoul Office

Greenpeaceâ€™s environmental monitoring vessel, Arctic Sunrise, has set sail for the Sargasso Sea in the North Atlantic to investigate whales, seabirds, and plastics. Greenpeace is working to have the Sargasso Sea designated as a protected area under a new global ocean treaty.

This voyage documented the beauty and unique ecosystem of the Sargasso Sea, while also collecting and investigating the plastic waste plaguing the ocean. Check out the photos from the Sargasso Sea expedition.
