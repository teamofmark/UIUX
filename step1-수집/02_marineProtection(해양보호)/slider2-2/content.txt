Greenpeace emphasizes in its report that in order to proteccont the ocean, it is urgent to designate marine protected areas through the enforcement of a global marine treaty.

This report analyzes global fishing activities using data from Global Fishing Watch, and confirms that in waters recommended as protected areas in the 2019 Greenpeace report ' 30x30: A Blueprint for Ocean Protection ', fishing vessels will spend 2,938,182 hours fishing in 2022, an increase of 22.5% (541,607 hours) from 2018. In addition, considering their ecological importance, the following areas were proposed as priority areas for designating marine protected areas: ▲The Emperor Seamount in the North Pacific, ▲The Sargasso Sea in the North Atlantic, ▲The South Tasman Sea and the Lord Howe Belt in the Southern Hemisphere, located between Australia and New Zealand.

The report highlights the urgency of establishing 30% of the world’s high seas as marine protected areas by 2030 through the entry into force of a global marine treaty, and the need for at least 60 countries to ratify and propose marine protected areas to achieve this.
