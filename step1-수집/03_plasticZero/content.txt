Campaign Objectives
Plastic pollution is a growing crisis. We need to get rid of plastic pollution by reducing plastic production and transitioning to a system based on reuse and refill, through a strong, legally binding international plastics agreement.

Did you know?
Microplastics are found everywhere. In Antarctic snow, in wild animal feces, and even in our blood and breast milk. Plastics are overwhelming our lives. Yet the global recycling rate is still only 9%. Plastics, which are made from over 99% fossil fuels, emit greenhouse gases and contribute to the climate crisis even after they are made and discarded.

Problem
Disposable plastics, which account for 40% of total plastic production, are mostly replaceable and unnecessary. The 'disposable' culture of using once and throwing it away. Because of its convenience, we are producing, consuming, and discarding a lot of plastic.
