We need to move away from plastic pollution.

The reason disposable plastics are produced and used indiscriminately is because there is no ‘regulation.’
Recycling, we work hard, but why is the Earth suffering from plastic waste?

The problem of plastic pollution is already too serious for one person or one country to tackle alone.

International laws and regulations require all countries to reduce their use and production of plastics to save ourselves and our planet from this serious pollution.

Recognizing the seriousness of the problem, governments around the world are coming together to discuss a 'global plastics agreement' to stop plastic pollution.

With your petition,
Reducing oil use in the plastics production phase
Hold producers who produce too much plastic accountable
Building a refill and reuse system
The above issues can be discussed in depth by each country's government. We need to show our voice and will to lead the journey of the international plastic agreement to success. Let's make the earth clean and safe for our children and ourselves!

We will deliver your petition to participating countries in the international conference to lead to a global commitment to reduce plastic.
