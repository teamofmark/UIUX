[Report] Plastic Korea 2.0 in 2023: Falling into the swamp of plastic consumption in the COVID-19 era

Written by: Kim Nara, Greenpeace Plastic Campaigner

Greenpeace, together with Professor Jang Yong-cheol's team at Chungnam National University, has published a report on plastic consumption trends since the COVID-19 era. Let's take a look at how much plastic we are currently consuming and what solutions there are through per capita plastic consumption and recycling rates for representative single-use plastics.

Greenpeace, together with Professor Jang Yong-cheol’s team at Chungnam National University, has published the report “Plastic Korea 2.0 - Falling into the swamp of plastic consumption in the COVID-19 era.” The report is the second report of “Plastic Korea, the temptation of disposables” published in 2019, and analyzes and investigates trends in domestic plastic waste generation, consumption footprints of representative disposable plastics, future generation forecasts, and trends in the international community.

According to the research results, the representative disposable plastic consumption footprint is 109 PET water bottles (1.6 kg), 102 disposable plastic cups (1.4 kg), 533 disposable plastic bags (10.7 kg), and 568 disposable plastic delivery containers (5.3 kg) per person in 2020. When the four items are added, it is shown that each person consumes about 19.0 kg of plastic per year. Compared to the 2017 data, which is the reference data for the previous report, PET water increased by 13.5% compared to 2017, disposable plastic cups increased by 56.9%, and disposable plastic bags increased by 15.9%. The domestic annual consumption of all investigated plastic items increased, and in particular, the consumption of disposable plastic cups increased significantly in 2020 compared to 2017.

When the amount of domestic plastic waste generation continues at the existing trend (BAU, Business As Usual), the amount of plastic waste in 2030 is estimated to be approximately 6,475 thousand tons/year among household waste in 2030, which is 3.6 times more than the amount of household waste generated in 2010 and 1.5 times more than the amount generated in 2020.

In addition, this report also estimated the material recycling rate to point out the limitations of recycling. In the previous report, based on 2017 data, the domestic material recycling rate of all plastics was approximately 22.7%, and the material recycling rate of household waste, which is estimated to be a large portion of disposable plastics, was only approximately 13%. If the same calculation is performed based on waste data from 2021, the overall domestic material recycling rate is approximately 27%, and the material recycling rate of household waste is still low at only approximately 16.4%, showing that recycling alone cannot solve the plastic pollution problem.

The report also compares domestic and international regulations on single-use plastics, provides an assessment of Korea’s regulations and the need for an international plastics agreement to combat plastic pollution worldwide, and presents demands for the Korean government and businesses that are the main causes of plastic pollution.
