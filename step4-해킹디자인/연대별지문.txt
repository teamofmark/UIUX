Greenpeace Marine Conservation History - [title]

[paragraph]
The use of fossil fuels is accelerating climate change and ocean acidification, putting the oceans at risk. Destructive fishing is destroying marine habitats and putting millions of species at risk of extinction. Scientists say the extinction of marine life in the next century could be the worst extinction since the age of the dinosaurs. But we can stop this crisis. If we act together, we can save the sea and the living things that live in it from crisis and protect the green planet.
